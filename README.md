The goal of this app is to create a rejection app. This will track instances of wins and rejections; 1 point per win, 10 points per rejection. Each instance will include what was requested, who was asked, whether it was successful ot not, and the time and date of the question.

Idea from medium.com. The following is the challenge copy and pasted
(https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-best-way-to-learn-to-code-is-to-code-learn-app-architecture-by-building-apps-7ec029db6e00)

Basic Level
Build a UI that lets you keep track of your score. Include a text input for the ask, who you asked, and two buttons: “Accepted” or “Rejected”. For asynchronous requests such as emails or messages, record the score at the time you get the answer, not at the time you ask.
Use HTML+CSS and store a record of the data in local storage.
Keep a running tally of the user’s current score. Remember that the day’s subtotal needs to be recalculated each time an ask is accepted or rejected, so it will be useful to keep the list in an array that you can reduce with each new answer.

Mid level
Add an API to store data using a web service and database.
Add authentication and track multiple users. Hint: Redis, Mongo, or RethinkDB would be good database candidates.
Social login such as Facebook or Twitter would be good authentication options (easier and more secure than username/password logins).

Advanced Level
Share your score and compete with your friends on Facebook.
For each user, keep a leaderboard from their circle of friends.

Extra credit
Add mobile apps
